            <p>The visualization is populated as you select and deselect tags. The nodes represent tags (Researchers, Departments, and Interests), and the lines the connection between them. The visualization supports the following actions:</br></br>
            <b>Show Node Title</b> Mouseover a node to reveal its title.</br></br>
            <b>Get Node Detail</b> Click on a node opens the node's information panel.</br></br>

            <b>Move Nodes</b> Mouse click, hold and drag a node. The layout adjusts according to the acting forces.</br></br>
            <b>Remove Node</b> Right-click on a node to remove it from the visualization. All connected nodes are affected by this action.</p>

            <div flex layout-padding class="md-body-1 no-vertical-margin">
                <p><b>Display</b> Choose between network [default] and cluster. The network presents a set of forces (gravity, charge, and distance) acting on the nodes and links to show the relationship between them. The cluster display only shows nodes grouped according to an attribute set by the user and affected only by gravity.</br></br>
                <b>Cluster</b> (cluster display only) Choose the attribute to be used in the clustering process: type (see Tags) [default] or community (see below).</br></br>
                <b>Gravity</b> This force act on the nodes. The default devalue is 1. Lower values lose the tension and pull the nodes to the edges (and outside) of the screen. Higher values increase the tension and push the nodes to the centre.</br></br>
                <b>Charge</b> (network display only) This force adds/increases the "electric charge" of a node; that is, it attraction or repellent force. The default is -60. Lower values increase the charge and make the nodes repel themselves with more force. Higher values have the opposite effect.</br></br>
                <b>Distance</b> (network display only) This force acts directly on the links. The default value is 40. Lower values decrease the link's length, pushing the nodes closer to its respective source; higher values increase the length, pushing nodes away from the source.</br></br>
                <span><b>Collision Detection</b> When turned on, this option detects and resolves nodes overlapping. It requires more computational power and can make get slower if the visualization has a high number of nodes. It is off by default.</span></br></br>
                <span><b>Community</b> Community is not an option, but an attribute dynamically computed every time a tag is added or removed from the visualization. The algorithm tries to put together tags that have connections in common, creating what is called modularity class.</span></br></br>
                <i>* You can use a combination of these options to fit the visualization on the screen size.</i></p>

            <div flex layout-padding class="md-body-1 no-vertical-margin">
                <p><b>Show nodes</b> Show and hide nodes.</br></br>
                <b>Size</b> Use an attribute to size the nodes. The options are default or weight. While the default sets all nodes with the same size, weight (see below) sets the maximum size based on the node with the highest connections and the minimum size based on the node with the lowest number of connections.</br></br>
                <b>Scale</b> Works as a multiplier for the nodes' current size.</br></br>
                <b>Colour</b> There are three options: default, type (see tags), and community (see Display). The default set all nodes to black. Type colour code nodes by type in using the following colours: Blue (Researchers), Orange (Departments), and dark grey (Interests). The community option uses a colour palette to colourize each cluster randomly. These colours might change if you chose the dark theme (see Extra).</br></br>
                <b>Weight</b> Weight is not an option, but an attribute dynamically computed every time a tag is added or removed from the visualization. It is based on the number of connections currently shown in the visualization. For instance, if a node has 4 connections, its weight is 4.</p>

                <p><b>Show links</b> Show and hide the connections between the nodes.</br></br>
                <b>Thickness</b> Defines the stroke width. Choose between default and weight (see Nodes). While the default sets thickness to 1 for all links, weight sets the line thickens based on the weight of its source. Thus, if a source node has weight 4 and the target weight 1, the line that connects the two have the thickness 4.</br></br>
                <b>Colour</b> Choose between default and community (see Display). The default sets link’s colour to light grey. Community sets line colour based on the community of its source.</br></br>
                <b>Strength</b> This option sets the tension force in each link. There are two options min [default] and max. Min corresponds to the minimum value between a source and a target, making the tension stronger and the nodes closer to their source. Max corresponds to the maximum value between a source and a target, making the tension weaker and their nodes distance from their sources.</p>

                <b>Gooey FX</b> Makes the nodes appear liquid and deformed, blending one into the other. It is computationally heavy when applied to the visualization with a high number of nodes, but it might have a weak effect when only a few modes are present in the visualization. It is not fully exportable (see Export).</p>
