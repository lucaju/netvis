            <b>Show Node Title</b> Mouse over a node to reveal its title.</br></br>
            <b>Get Node Detail</b> Click on a node open the node's information panel.</br></br>

            <b>Remove Node</b> Right-click on a node to remove it from the visualization. All the nodes only connected to this node will also be removed.</p>

                <p><b>Display</b> Choose between network [default] and cluster. While the network display presents a set of forces (gravity, charge, and distance) acting on the nodes and links to show the relationship between them, the cluster display only shows nodes grouped according to an attribute set by the user and affected only be gravity.</br></br>
                <b>Cluster</b> (cluster display only) Choose the attribute to be used in the clustering process: type (see Tags) [default] or community (see below).</br></br>
                <b>Gravity</b> This force act on the nodes. The default devalue is 1. Lower values will lose the tension and pull the nodes to the edges (and outside) of the screen. Higher values increase the tension and push the nodes to the centre.</br></br>
                <b>Charge</b> (network display only) This force adds/increases the "electric charge" of a node; that is, it attraction or repellent force. The default is -60. Lower values increase the charge and make the nodes repel themselves with more force. Higher values have the opposite effect.</br></br>
                <b>Distance</b> (network display only) This force acts directly on the links. The default value is 40. Lower values decrease the link's length, pushing the nodes closer to its respective source; higher values increase the length, pushing nodes away from the source.</br></br>
                <span><b>Collision Detection</b> When turned on, this option detects and resolves nodes overlapping. It requires more computational power and can make get slower if the visualization has a high number of nodes. It is off by default.</span></br></br>
                <span><b>Community</b> Community is not an option, but an attribute dynamically computed every time a tag is added or removed from the visualization. The algorithm tries to put together tags that have connections in common, creating what is call community of nodes.</span></br></br>

            <div flex layout-padding class="md-body-1 no-vertical-margin">
                <p><b>Show nodes</b> Show and hide nodes.</br></br>
                <b>Size</b> Use an attribute to size the nodes. The options are default or weight. While the default set all nodes with the same size, weight (see below) set the maximum size based on the node with the highest connections and the minimum size based on the node with lowest connections.</br></br>
                <b>Scale</b> Works as a multiplier for the nodes current size.</br></br>
                <b>Colour</b> There are three options: default, type (see tags), and community (see Display). The default set all nodes to black. Type colour code nodes by type in using the following colours: Blue (Researchers), Orange (Departments), and dark grey (Interests). The community option uses a colour palette to randomly colonize each cluster. These colours might change if you chose the dark theme (see Extra).</br></br>
                <b>Weight</b> Weight is not an option, but an attribute dynamically computed every time a tag is added or removed from the visualization. It is based on the number of connections currently shown in the visualization. For instance, if a node has 4 connections, its weight is 4.</p>

                <p><b>Show links</b> Show and hide the connections between the nodes.</br></br>
                <b>Thickness</b> Choose between default and weight (see Nodes). While the default sets thickness to 1 for all links, weight sets the line thickens based on the weight of its source. Thus, if a source node has weight 4 and the target weight 1, the line that connects the two will have thickness 4.</br></br>
                <b>Colour</b> Choose between default and community (see Display). Default sets link’s colour to light grey. Community sets line colour based on the community of its source.</br></br>
                <b>Strength</b> This option sets the tension force in each link. There are two options min [default] and max. Min correspond to the minimum value between a source and a target, making the tension stronger and the nodes closer to their source; Max correspond to the maximum value between a source and a target, making the tension weaker and their nodes distance from their sources.</p>

                <b>Gooey FX</b> Makes the nodes appear liquid and deformed, blending one into the other. It is computationally heavy when applied to a visualization with a high number of nodes, but it might have a weak effect when only a few modes are present in the visualization.

                <p><b>Export Data</b> [Editors and Administrators only] There are two options: CSV and JSON. The CSV option generates two files, one containing the nodes and metadata and the other the relationship between the nodes. The JSON option generates one file containing both the nodes and metadata, and their relationship.</p>

            <div>
                <p><b>Export Graph</b> There are two options: PNG and SVG. The PNG option generates a raster file with transparent background. All the nodes and links currently present in the visualization, including those partially or totally hidden or outside the main screen, will be in the generated image. The SVG option generates a vector-based file that can be opened in the browser or in any vector-based image editor (e.g., Adobe Illustrator). The file is clipped by the main screen container, but you can manually remove this clip to exposed all the nodes and links present on the visualization when it was exported. While Gooey FX is embedded in the SVG file — though some applications might not display it properly, the FX will be removed in the PNG file.</p>
